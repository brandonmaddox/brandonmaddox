### Hi there 👋
<!--

I am a data scientist recovering from starting in the wrong field...

The pursuits I love most in this world are data projects, computer programming, being a father, and optimizing my physical health and mental well-being. I am currently completing a Master's of Science degree in Analytics from Texas A&M University, where I am working on predicting the quality of care in Texas hospitals.

Type 1 diabetic for over 30 years, obsessed with achieving normal blood glucose levels using diet, exercise, and insulin. I build my life around continuous personal improvement and make it a point to learn something new or develop a current skillset every single day.

- 🔭 I'm currently sharpening my programming skills through consistent daily practice on HackerRank. Check out my progress on my HackerRank profile. https://www.hackerrank.com/bmaddox10913

- 🌱 At school, I'm currently learning about data warehousing (all that data you have, it has to be stored somewhere), sales/marketing analytics (how satisfaction impacts customer lifetime value), and modern regression methods. Find out more about the MS Analytics program here -> https://mays.tamu.edu/ms-analytics/

- 🏠 At home, I'm programming, working on personal data projects, and building my brand through my personal website. Check it out at -> https://www.maddoxmachinelearning.com/

- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects, participate in machine learning competitions, and broaden my network within the data community. LinkedIn -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-maddox-pmp/

- 💬 Ask me about my diabetes, my data projects, my son, my fitness journey, anything... Just say hi! My email is below.

```python
    #!/bin/python3
    def get_email(user_entry):
        if user_entry.lower() == 'yes':
            server = 'gmail.com'
            last, first = 'maddox', 'b'
            num = 10000 + 913
            print(first + last + str(num) + '@' + '{}'.format(server))
        else:
            print('Ok, have a nice day!')
            
    user_entry = input('Can I give you my email address? (yes/no): ')
    get_email(user_entry)
```
