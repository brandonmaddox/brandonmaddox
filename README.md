### Hi there 👋

<!--
**brandonmaddox/brandonmaddox** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a data scientist recovering from starting out in the wrong field... 

The pursuits I love most in this world are data projects, computer programming, being a father, and optimizing my physical health and mental well-being. Currently completing a Master's of Science degree in Analytics from Texas A&M University where I am working on predicting quality of care in Texas hospitals. 

Type 1 diabetic for over 30 years, obsessed with achieving normal blood glucose levels using diet, exercise, and insulin. I build my life around continuous personal improvement and either learn something new or develop a current skillset every. single. day.

- 🔭 I’m currently sharpening my programming skills through consistent daily practice on HackerRank. Check out my progress on my HackerRank profile. https://www.hackerrank.com/bmaddox10913 

- 🌱 At school, I’m currently learning about data warehousing (all that data you have, it has to be stored somewhere), sales/marketing analytics (how stasfaction impacts whether a customer will purchase and how much) as well as modern regression methods. 

- 🏠 At home, I'm programming, working on personal data projects, learning about git, github, and version control. 
 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, particpate in machine learnng competitions, and broaden the my network within the data community.

- 💬 Ask me about my diabetes, my personal data projects, my son, fitness journey, anything really... Just say hi! My email is below. 
   
```python
    #!/bin/python3
    def get_email(user_entry):
        if user_entry.lower() == 'yes':
            server = 'gmail.com'
            last, first = 'maddox', 'b'
            num = 10000 + 913
            print(first + last + str(num) + '@' + '{}'.format(server))
        else:
            print('Ok, have a nice day!')
            
    user_entry = input('Can I give you my email address? (yes/no): ')
    get_email(user_entry)
```
